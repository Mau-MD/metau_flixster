### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they prepared me. I never felt unprepared.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would love to have a dark/light mode toggle. Also would love to have multiple filters (trending, on cinemas, etc.)

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I thing almost everything went well. Had some issues with some event listeners, but eventually got them working. I manage to fix some issues my instructor pointed out. (For example debounce! I didn't know about it)
